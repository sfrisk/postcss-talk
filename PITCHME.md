## First, Hello

@SarahFrisk

---

## What ~~is~~ isn't PostCSS?

---

## It isn't a preprocessor*
#### *But it can be used to act like one.

---

## You may already be using it now.*
#### *Especially if you're already using a JavaScript build tool to transform your CSS.

---

## Cut to the chase, what is PostCSS?

---

## Post CSS is a Tool:
#### A Node.js module that is used to create JS Plugins that transform styles.

---

### CSS -> Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) -> Plugins -> Stringifier -> CSS

---

## PostCSS doesn't actually alter the CSS. Plugins creating using PostCSS alter the CSS.

---

## What sort of plugins does PostCSS offer?
